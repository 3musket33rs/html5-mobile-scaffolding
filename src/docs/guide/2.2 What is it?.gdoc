Grails supports a feature known as static scaffolding which involves the generation of a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) interface for a given domain class. Once generated, the controller can be modified by you but they won't automatically update when you change the domain class.

Generating HTML5 web mobile application is as easy as using standard Grails scaffolding. Html5-mobile-scaffolding is using static scaffolding. The idea is to give you the skeleton of the application for CRUD operation and then it's up to you to modify it. 

As html5-mobile-scaffolding plugin targets mobile application, the challenge is to scaffold an application that can be fully installed as an hybrid application using PhoneGap build or Cordova command line. The controller part is minimal and serves RESTfull services as JSON.
