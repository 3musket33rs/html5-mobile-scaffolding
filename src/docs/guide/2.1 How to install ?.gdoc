Ideally, add the plugin dependency into @BuildConfig.groovy@. It is important that the plugin is scoped as @compile@, otherwise you may get some unexpected problems if you are letting the plugin manage your datasource config:

{code}
plugins {
   compile ':html5-mobile-scaffolding:0.4'
}
{code}

Alternately you can use the install-plugin command in grails:

{code}
grails install-plugin html5-mobile-scaffolding
{code}
