h4. How to install?

Ideally, add the plugin dependency into @BuildConfig.groovy@. It is important that the plugin is scoped as @compile@, otherwise you may get some unexpected problems if you are letting the plugin manage your datasource config:

{code}
plugins {
   compile ':html5-mobile-scaffolding:0.1'
}
{code}

Alternately you can use the install-plugin command in grails:

{code}
grails install-plugin html5-mobile-scaffolding
{code}

h4. What is it?

Grails supports a feature known as static scaffolding which involves the generation of a CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) interface for a given domain class. Once generated, the controller can be modified by you but they won't automatically update when you change the domain class.

Generating HTML5 web mobile application is as easy as using standard Grails scaffolding. Html5-mobile-scaffolding is using static scaffolding. The idea is to give you the skeleton of the application for CRUD operation and then it's up to you to modify it. 

As html5-mobile-scaffolding plugin is targeted mobile application, the challenge was to scaffold an application that can be fully installed as an hybrid application (for example) using phone-gap plugin. The controller part is minimal and serves RESTfull services as JSON. 

Providing service that will be installed on client device required JSONP plugin to allow JSON with padding (see jsonp plugin for more details). 

h4. Give me samples

Let's start with a simple application using geolocalisation.

h4. What is generated?
Generate Controller
From domain class controller class is generated. Controller renders as JSON.
{code}
    def list() {
      params.max = Math.min(params.max ? params.int('max') : 10, 100)
     	render Book.list(params) as JSON
    }
{code}
